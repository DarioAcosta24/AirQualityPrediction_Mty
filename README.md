# Air Quality Prediction in Monterrey
_By Darío Acosta Natividad_

## **Project Overview**  
Monterrey, Nuevo León, México, is one of the largest industrial cities in the country. The extensive industrial activity in the city has significantly impacted air quality, posing serious health risks to its residents. It is crucial for the government to understand air quality trends in order to implement preventive measures and mitigate potential disasters. This project focuses on predicting levels of "PM2.5," which are microscopic air particles that are highly dangerous to human health.

## **Objectives**  
- Accurately predict "PM2.5" levels in the air.
- Identify trends in "PM2.5" concentrations over time.
- Provide an in-depth analysis of "PM2.5" levels and their associated health risks.
